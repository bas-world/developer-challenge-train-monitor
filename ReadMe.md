# Train monitor

Build a small application which shows all arrivals and departures of trains for a selected Station in The Netherlands.
Show this information on a dashboard. Obtain the necessary information using the NS Reisinformatie API.

Find all NS (Nationale Spoorwegen) APIs here: https://apiportal.ns.nl

Make sure to sign up for an account as an External user. After logging in you need
the "[Reisinformatie API](https://apiportal.ns.nl/docs/services/reisinformatie-api/operations/getArrivals)" to do what
you need.

## Requirements

At minimum do:

- Use git and make your project publicly available to us
- Make use of the API mentioned above
- Use the most recent PHP version
- Use a framework
- Show arrivals & departures in the coming hour of your selected station
- Show any disruptions to service
- **Make sure to have documentation in a ReadMe of any quirks we need to know about, such running a migration!**

Additional (if you feel like it):

- Pagination
- Ability to change the station from which to show data
- Cache data
- Use geolocation to determine closest station

### Demo the project

To be able to run the project we want to run a maximum of 3 commands:

- clone the project
- install dependencies
- (optional) start containers

_**This is a test to show off your skills in thinking through a problem. Your way of working, decision-making process,
knowledge of design patterns, etc. are more important that a fully functional, slick looking product!**_

**Spend a maximum of 4 hours on the project, it's only a show-case, not your lifes work** :)
